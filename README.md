## General Information

- A consumer finance company, specialised in lending various types of loans to urban customers wants to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
    - If applicant is likely to repay the loan then rejecting leads to loss of business
    - If applicant is not likely to repay the loan then approving leads to loss of capital, which is significant loss.

- Here we are trying to come up with driving factors which influence applicants going default.

- Dataset used : https://github.com/KalpeshChaniyara/LendingClubCaseStudy/blob/main/loan.csv
